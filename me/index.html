Hello, I&rsquo;m Eisuke (英祐), currently an undergrad generally interested in robot learning. I&rsquo;ve a keen interest in (inverse) Reinforcement Learning and commonsense reasoning. As of now, I&rsquo;ve mainly worked in quadruped locomotion and manipulation, as well as preference-based rl. My long-term mission is to contribute to the development of robots to human-inhabited environments (such as in hospitals or the home) that collaborate with us, with reasoning.
Experience:

TBD, MIT Lincoln Lab, (2025)
Prof. Erdem Biyik, LiraLab, USC (2024-present)
Prof. Shiqi Zhang, Air, SUNY Binghamton (2022-2024)
Prof. Chen Feng, AI4CE, NYU (2022-2023)
