    <h2>Gap semester</h2>

    

    <p>For various reasons, the latter half of my 2025 ended up becoming a gap semester. I graduated undergrad back in May with no certain future prospect of the upcoming years: I didn&rsquo;t hear back anything promising from my PhD admissions cycle nor job applications. Fortunately I had an internship lined up for the summer, and there I made connections to then lead to my current work with Purdue. Herein, I spent a good amount of my time from August to now leading a research project and learning a lot. I then got into MS starting spring 2026 and decided to commit to grad school. So looking back, my fall 2025 now looks like a gap semester.</p>
<hr>
<p>Looking at the time I spent, overall it felt decently productive (w.r.t my life and not specifically career/academia/job or whatever label). Below I write things that happened (or didn&rsquo;t happen), not really about research.</p>
<p>Things I found myself prioritizing:</p>
<ul>
<li>Games:
<ul>
<li>Rhythm: During my summer internship, I played a ton of Maimai with friends I made. Since I enjoyed it a lot, I planned to continue afterwards, and during the beginning of my gap sem, I often went to Gigo Ikebukuro to play Maimai. I haven&rsquo;t played in a month or two but I peaked around level 11-12 I think. I&rsquo;ll definitely get back into it.</li>
<li>Story: Almost done with Kingdom Hearts and finished Inazuma Eleven Victory Road. I&rsquo;m also heavily procrastinating on FF9, Chrono Trigger, and Raidou. I&rsquo;ll get to them&hellip; eventually. Playing and finishing story games always leaves a sentimental mark on me, like sobbing your soul after your first watch of La La Land.</li>
<li>Multiplayer: I first was grinding DbD but once I got into SF6 I moved all my time to that. Perhaps I&rsquo;m an adrenaline-junky or something b/c from a long time ago I enjoyed competition a lot. Given my history of competitive games, I always knew that pros spent a ton of time getting good, but I think SF6 is where I truly first felt the absurd skill gap between me and the best.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Health stuff:
<ul>
<li>Gym: I actually wanted to start boxing or MMA, but the gyms here looked absurdly expensive. So, I decided to go to a regular gym and just lift weights. Progress was overall slow but I found some small gains here and there, particularly with my pecs and lats. I didn&rsquo;t expect too much though given I don&rsquo;t spend that much time, so I overall felt content with this.</li>
<li>Running: My endurance has always been pretty poor since I was a child, mainly due to my asthma being severe back then (now it&rsquo;s basically non-existent). I thus started running more, particularly focusing on consistency, 3-4 times a week to prevent breaking my knees. Overall made some progress. My pace right now is pretty lackluster (11min/mile across 3 miles) but I&rsquo;ll get better. I&rsquo;m prioritizing running as roadwork, not marathon-running, so it&rsquo;d be nice if I can consistently run at around 8-9min/mile pace without being overwhelmed afterwards.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Things I planned to do but didn&rsquo;t spend much time on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sewing: We have a small sewing machine and I live right next to the garment district area, so I planned to sew a lot. I still enjoy it and did find it cool in the beginning (e.g. learning tricks like using stacking old newspapers on top of stretchy fabric to ensure the fabric doesn&rsquo;t move). I ended up sewing a zipper onto a tote bag and a couple drawstring pouches to put stuff inside.</li>
<li>Airsoft: I&rsquo;ve never played but I wanted to at least try it out.</li>
<li>Learning a new language: maybe spanish or korean since they aren&rsquo;t syntactically too different from english.</li>
<li>Overall, I think the main reason I ended up not pursuing these is because I legitimately have zero friends here. I was pursuing individual hobbies too much, I eventually started feeling lonely; hence I later shifted towards playing games online w/ friends.</li>
</ul>
<p>Other thoughts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Spontaneously, I attended some ML symposium/conference/get-together event and met some people and was offered an internship. I eventually turned them down, but I felt very lucky and I guess I find that even the smallest efforts you put in stack up to reward you.</li>
<li>My legs hurt a lot due to running. I learned that foam rollers really help with preventing pain, and using it especially the muscle near my knees helped to prevent knee pain. When I increased my running distance from around 2 to 3 miles over a weekend though, it seems my legs were completely worn out and couldn&rsquo;t adapt b/c I had to take more than a week to recover&ndash;my calves hurt pretty bad and the foam roller doesn&rsquo;t help with fatigue like this.</li>
<li>Finding housing when you&rsquo;re not in-state (and not even in-country) is horrible. Maybe it&rsquo;s just LA but many places are so expensive and/or the management has horrendous reviews. I was able to do a few virtual tours but nothing was promising and also in my budget. I also don&rsquo;t know anyone to room with, so it&rsquo;s not like I can find share/townhouses or multi-bed apartments. I respect anyone who finds success.</li>
</ul>
