🦑 My thoughts on food

If I could, I&rsquo;d be eating 24/7. I like food a lot and can talk about it for years.
My favorite food is the pho I find around Jackson Heights / Elmhurst. I get all the types of meat (I like tripe and tendon especially) and add all the bean sprouts, lime, and herbs. Depending on the day I may or may not add a bit of sriracha in the soup but not too much such that it covers the flavor of the broth.
I don&rsquo;t avoid any particular foods though I don&rsquo;t think I see myself eating mammals besides pigs, cows, goats/lambs/sheep. I did eat horse meat before as it&rsquo;s a thing in Japan; it didn&rsquo;t leave much of an impression so I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll try it ever again.
Oh, but I do think chocolate is overrated. Chocolate ice cream, cake, pain au chocolat, cocoa puffs. Literally none of them are even close to being my go-to-choice. I do like me a good chocolate truffle though.
Steak is also overrated. I do enjoy all of them: dry-aged, steak and eggs at 2 am in IHOP, picanha, wagyu, etc. But it&rsquo;s just so pricey for what. Also surely not all high-end restaurants aren&rsquo;t one trick ponies only able to serve expensive pieces of steak with a buttload of truffles and caviar right? I know a select are innovative (e.g. The French Laundry), but every YouTube video highlights steak, truffles, and caviar ONLY.
I currently have three knives: a gyuto, pairing, and nakiri. All three are Japanese handcrafted steel. The first two have a western grip and the last a Japanese wooden grip. Personally I find western grips favorable.
The best and laziest dish I&rsquo;d recommend making is buldak-sauce fried rice:


Follow J Kenji Lopez Alt&rsquo;s recipe in making fried rice in a home setting (without the blowtorch stuff) using whatever toppings you&rsquo;d like. Instead of adding all the sauces at the end though, just add half a packet of the sauce that comes in the 1x spicy buldak ramen. Mix it around and serve.">

<li>I barely know anything about the economics regarding serving &ldquo;shitty ethnic&rdquo; food but am inevitably a consumer of such and am not entirely against it (they tend to be a great gateway into learning more about certain cuisine and are usually rooted in immigrant history, e.g. Chinese takeout). Nevertheless, I think Japanese food in America can be so much better; it&rsquo;s either just low-end sushi, steak, and ramen or high-end sushi, steak, and ramen. I&rsquo;m kinda surprised at how this cuisine is looked at with such high regard by the fine-dining industry (e.g. <a href="https://youtube.com/shorts/CjhPUsB3QV4?si=ILmUREHseqc3Nhta">the late Anthony Bourdain praising it</a>), and yet haven&rsquo;t seen any actual venture by someone leaving their fine-dining restaurant and making good Japanese food that&rsquo;s authentic. Because no one is eating only sushi, steak, and ramen every day (unless you do ramen reviews). Great options are the Yoshinoya / Marugame extension in LA and also the Hawaiian fast food stores (which aren&rsquo;t Japanese per-say but are related in cuisine; e.g. spam-musubi and katsu), but these aren&rsquo;t ventures by some ex-Michelin-starred-restaurant chef.</li>

<p>My current (as of Aug 21, 2025) recipe involves a small spoonful of hot fudge (Ms. Richardson&rsquo;s) into a glass of milk and a big spoonful or two of dark cocoa powder (Hershey&rsquo;s Dark) whirred with a whirrer device.</p>

<h2 id="-my-thoughts-on-thrifting-whether-in-america-or-japan">👖 My thoughts on thrifting (whether in America or Japan)</h2>
<ul>
<li>I love to thrift, but it&rsquo;s honestly such a coin-flip and you really need to high roll to get anything nice. Statistically, finding anything good that&rsquo;s within one&rsquo;s budget is so low; fortunately, if you can go multiple times then the odds should balance out and you should be able to find something.</li>
<li>That being said, thrifting really depends on (i) what clothes you want (ii) why you want those clothes (iii) what size you are. Of course budget is a huge factor, but even if you have infinite money, these three factors inevitably come back.</li>
<li>On (i). Say you want 90s and beyond clothing, maybe some T-shirt you&rsquo;d find at Old Navy or Target. Then the odds you&rsquo;d find that T-shirt is probably like 100% at any thrift store that mass buys clothes (Goodwill in America or like 90% of the shops in Shimo-kitazawa, Tokyo). The problem is that I think within the thrifting customer base, there exists a good chunk of people, including me, that want to thrift to buy more niche clothes at a cheaper price. For example, I find designs made by (once-in-the-past) small studios or high-end fashion really fun and refreshing (what comes into mind is Bape), but I really don&rsquo;t want to drop like 3 bands per purchase, so I look towards thrift stores to possibly find them. Unfortunately, the chance you&rsquo;ll find any of these with a completely low-balled price tag is so low, so you need to be consistent in visiting places to find anything.</li>
<li>On (ii). If the goal for you is to upcycle clothes, then buying clothes from Goodwill (or something like Bookoff in Japan) is probably heaven. There&rsquo;s bound to be such a wide range of very affordable clothes, so you&rsquo;ll be able to find and test out different fabrics, sizes, designs, and textures. If you&rsquo;re goal is to just wear and not upcycle, then this leads to my next point.</li>
<li>On (iii). Let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re trying to find some zip-up to wear and you actually found one that looks nice. &ldquo;Great!&rdquo; you think, until you realize that the size is completely unusable for you. I&rsquo;m a really short dude, 5'3 or 164 cm. I&rsquo;m pretty far from the American stdev but I&rsquo;m not too bad from the Japanese stdev. Anyway, 90% of the clothes I find are L or XL or XXL. If I wear a t-shirt of that size, it&rsquo;s like I&rsquo;m wearing a onesie. If I wear pants that size, I need like 4 belts for it to fit. After my many outings to stores, I realize that the chance I find something that works to be pretty low. Now, I realize that I&rsquo;m a rare case given my stature, but even if a person is within one stdev away from the median or even above the median, I&rsquo;d hypothesize that they&rsquo;d also struggle to find something that works. For example, I&rsquo;d bet that a woman interested in finding low-rise jeans will struggle in finding a pair of pants that fit all criteria such that (i) it looks nice and isn&rsquo;t full of stains/holes, (ii) is well-structured so that she feels confident AND comfortable with how her butt fits, and most importanly (iii) is well-structured so that it&rsquo;s not like the McQueen Bumster (doesn&rsquo;t show one&rsquo;s buttcrack). I feel like most jeans found at thrift stores will fail all three criteria.</li>
<li>Nevertheless, I&rsquo;ll still keep at it on going to thrift stores. There&rsquo;s a sense of appreciation when you look at older clothes and how they were constructed, as well as the different eras of styles that came and gone. I&rsquo;ve found various nice pieces over the years and have been accustomed to almost always taking them with me wherever I go. I hope that with these thoughts you can also get a more wholistic view of thrifting and still be patient and have a leap of faith into believing nice pieces will come your way as well (like the cat distribution system).</li>
