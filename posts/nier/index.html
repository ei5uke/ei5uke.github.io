        I like entertainment, and a huge part of the reason I'm into math and cs and stuff is due to the fiction material 
        I've ingested. Subsequently, I want to talk about <b>all</b> the fiction material that's impacted my life and my thoughts.
    </p>

    <p>
        This is because sci-fi brings up many points that ponder how the world will be impacted by new technology. I 
        mean for one, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WarGames">War Games</a> hypothesized how a hacker could breach the military
        and launch a nuke - this <b>fictional</b> story persuaded the federal government to relook at 
        the, then current, regulations regarding internet protocol.
    </p>

    <p>
        Continuing on this <i>doomer</i> perspective, today I'm introducing NieR: Automata.  FYI,
        there'll be spoilers. So, if you don't want the adventure to get ruined, here's the tdlr: conscious robots question their existence.
    </p>

    <figure style="display:block; margin: auto; width:75%">

    <p>
        The context follows such: aliens invade the earth but don't want to sacrifice soldiers; and humans don't want to die neither. 
        To maximize damage and minimize deaths, aliens and humans engage in a proxy war, where the aliens have deployed 
        robots and humans have implemented androids. Now, the robots and androids fight indefinitely.
    </p>

    <p>
        Crucially, robots and androids have been fighting for generations, all for the sake of their creators. That is their purpose. 
        The audience plays the game through the perspective of 2B, 9S, and A2, all androids, and we villainize the robots and aliens.
        We have faith in the humans who created us, and we believe eden awaits our victory in this war.
    </p>

    <p>
        "Essence before existence." This stance is what the androids believe in. The androids believe that there is a 
        predetermined reason for their existence, akin to how tools are created for a specific task. The objective to cut a tree down
        existed first, next came the axe. The aliens started invading Earth, next came the androids.
    </p>

    <p>
        Throughout the game, however, the audience and androids start to uncover various truths that question their faith. We fight for 
        the humans and against the aliens, but we never actually meet our or our enemies' creators. Later on, it's revealed that 
        the humans and aliens have been wiped extinct - both the robots and androids' creators are dead. Why are we fighting for the humans 
        now?
    </p>

    <p>
        "The robots killed the humans - we must bring justice to our enemies and kill all the robots!" In all fiction, 
        this is traditionally what happens next. Unfortunately, the game presents a few more twists here too.
    </p>

    <p>
        We first meet the robot Pascal and his pacifist tribe, full of robot families and dog robots that all 
        just like to enjoy their home in the forest. They have no intention of harming anyone and they prove it - they have disposed of 
        their weapons and only carry books, toys, and money. 
    </p>

    <p>
        We also start to find robots in the world imitating higher life, particulary our creators' (human) lives. Some enjoy decorating 
        their armored body with makeup
        and going to the amusement park. Others like to gamble and watch gladiator fights. And many, if not all, legitimately start 
        frolicking in public. No shame against public sex in robot society I guess. 
    </p>

        <img src=/img/amusement.png style="display:block; margin: auto; width:100%" > 
        <figcaption>Amusement Park fanart by marblegallery7.</figcaption>
    </figure> 

    <p>
        Lastly, if that was not enough to persuade androids to stop harming robots, we uncover the truth that robots and androids are 
        both built upon the same vital core. In other words, by killing a robot, you are essentially killing an android.
    </p>

    <p>
        You realize that your creator is dead, so no eden. And your moral compass dissuades you from killing 
        children and pacifists. Now, 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_Do_You_Live%3F">How do you Live?™</a>
    </p>

    <p>
        <center>
            ...
        </center>
    </p>

    <p>
        NieR presents the audience with an existential question through the lenses of these androids' lives. Funnily, like a little easter egg,
        various robots are named after existentialists and philosophers, Jean-Paul (Sartre) and Simone (de Beauvoir), and Pascal criticises 
        Nietzsche's famous words, "God is dead."
    </p>

    <p>
        This game is trully amazing, and there exists great analyses that explain NieR's profound message; I really enjoyed this 
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RhAA-KDnuw0">video</a> by Max Derrat.
    </p>

    <p>
        But today, I'd like to mainly emphasize the importance of how 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_singularity">singularity</a>
        is presented in this game. Clearly, the robots and androids have 
        reached conscious 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence">AGI</a>, 
        and have some sense of consciousness, emotion, spiritualism, the list goes on. While I'd guess that many people 
        would love to create such robots, I think NieR presents a world where we shouldn't. Perhaps the people interested in conscious AGI should 
        ask themselves deep down: Why do I want robots to have a consciousness? Will a consciousness truly help human society, 
        whether through a second industrial revolution or through aiding the elderly and disabled? Or is this search for a robot 
        consciousness solely a matter of power hungry individuals wanting to claim some sense of victory, and agency,
        over their cruel, little life?
    </p>

    <p>
        By the end of the game, 2B, 9S, and A2 all have an unsightly ending - that is if you got ending C or D, and not ending E. 
        Ending E presents a hopeful future, one where robots and androids can keep living with or without faith. To preface, I
        do not believe in a supernatural god, but I base some of my values on various religions like Buddhism and Shintoism 
        (probably influenced from my Japanese ethnic origins). As such, I believe that ending E shows how 
        humanity can continue living with hope towards the future. Similarly, other conscious 
        beings (perhaps robots and androids) can also continue a tangential path.
    </p>

    <p>
        That being said, I personally don't like Superior Iron Man - I don't think humans should be playing god. I think, 
        philosophically speaking, there exists no morally acceptable reason to create conscious AGI. I'm heavily biased, however, given my 
        second belief that I (to some extent) believe that having children is unethical. If God does exist though, then clearly 
        he/she/it gave humans the capability to recreate, hence, reproduction is ethical by matter of "essence before existence." 
        Other reasons exist too that argue for birthing children, though that's a topic for another day.
    </p>

    <p>
        When it comes to birthing consciousness within robots and androids, what takes higher priority is perhaps the 
        existential threat of human life. As another higher life is born with consciousness possibly superior to ours, what 
        prevents them from wiping us out? This mindset is pretty doomer, but truthfully I don't think there's any true way to stop 
        this without fully preventing it from ever happening. If we fly to close to the sun thinking that we're god, we'll realize 
        our false wings have melted, plunging us down into the depths of the ocean, never to be seen again.
    </p>

    <p>
        This does not mean that robots need not exist - Dario Amodei's 
        <a href="https://darioamodei.com/machines-of-loving-grace">blog</a> explains great reason for us to continue without 
        the need to play god. Robots are superior machines, I believe, not human equals. This is something a lot of people that ingest 
        sci-fi probably must engrain into their minds, especially children who fantasize robots and other death machines. 
        I'm pretty glad to have experienced NieR - it definitely made me question my stance on AGI and my naivete surrounding 
        robots. 
    </p>

    <p>
        I'm planning to continue this series and talk about other pieces that made me interested in robots. Given my recent completion 
        of Naoki Urasawa's <i>Billy Bat</i>, next time I'll talk about his other series - <i>Pluto</i>. Today's thoughts 
        were pretty dark, and also heaily connected to philosophy and my research. Instead, I want to also highlight great fiction 
        pieces that depict cool robots and increase the fanbase to the fiction I ingest. Ironically, Pluto is also dark, philosophical, 
        and related to my research, so I think me solely nerding over robots without relating to human existence will happen another time.
