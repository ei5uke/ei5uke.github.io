🇯🇵 Japan suggestions
Everybody and their mama going to Japan these past years (2023 onwards) so I&rsquo;ve gotten asked for suggestions. Here I just type some out:

ramen: kikanbo for a spicy miso, kyushu jangara for tonkotsu
jpn fast food: yoshinoya/sukiya for beef bowls (either called gyu-meshi or gyu-don); coco-ichibanya for jpn curry
chain restaurants: tori kizoku for chicken skewers; gyukaku for jpn bbq (but theres gyukaku in flushing so u can always try that back there); gyoza no ohsho for chinese-jpn food; u can always find pasta/okonomiyaki/other food chain stores near the top floor of malls/department stores
korean food: any store in shin-ookubo bc thats basically ktown, i went here (https://maps.app.goo.gl/pWhTTmXz45eM8oF16?g_st=ipc) before I think and found it pretty good
desserts: the cream puffs at cow cow kitchen (there’s a location next to akihabara station); the pudding from morozoff’s (jpn pudding is more like flan and not the thing jello makes lol); pon de ring from mister donuts
places1: yanaka ginza and yanaka cemetary near ueno park. A street of old stores and stuff u can find places to eat or buy and then u can walk towards a cemetary (lol) or to ueno park which has a zoo and the art museum iirc. u can then walk to akihabara and do stuff there
places2: ikebukuro. honestly theres tons of tourists here but i think more ppl craze over going to akihabara instead of ikebukuro when they virtually offer the same things
