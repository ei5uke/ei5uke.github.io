Hello, I’m Eisuke (英祐). I am generally interested in robotics, machine learning, and probabilistic inference. To this end, I have performed research in reinforcement learning and reward learning, algorithmic human-robot interaction, approximate Bayesian inference for active learning, RLHF through various feedback modalities, and evolutionary algorithms for non-convex optimization problems. My long-term mission is to contribute to the development of robots to human-inhabited environments (such as in hospitals or the home) that collaborate with us, with reasoning.">
